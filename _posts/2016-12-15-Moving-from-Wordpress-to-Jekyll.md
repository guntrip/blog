You would be correct in assuming that the only input I make to this website is routinely overhauling everything about it, writing some posts about how I did that, and then forgetting it exists for another year.

Here’s instalment two (three?) of these. I’ve moved the entire website from Wordpress, hosted on a shared server, to Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator. My favourite part of this is the ability to use the Liquid templating language to take a lot of control over the build of your static site.

I’ll write a few posts about the different parts of this blog and website and how I recreated them in Jekyll. For now, you can look at the code here:
