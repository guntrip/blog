I’ve spoken to a lot of people who choose to take a creative degree in something they were incredibly passionate about, every single person agrees that several years of intense study in your chosen subject does a great job of leaving you with a degree but zero passion. I studied BA (Hons) Photography, it was a wonderful course and I got to work with some great artists but the stress of the Final Major Project left me with no intention of picking up a camera any time soon.

That was some years ago now. I’ve been trying very hard to get back into photography; it’s difficult as I’m no longer in the creative environment that the Arts Institute provided. I still speak to people from the course but they all feel the same as me.

About two years ago I decided to start a project. My [previous projects](http://www.steveguntrip.co.uk/photography/) have always been linear documentary projects, usually presented in a book, where I’d create a character and act the project out through them, recording the results. I’ve always seen it as part-performance and part-documentary. For this new project I’m dealing with measurements, specifically the **heaped teaspoon**. I love this measurement because it’s less of an exact measure and more of a challenge; if the instructions on this coffee say three heaped teaspoons then I like to try and REALLY heap it on. To that end, I have been visiting my friends kitchens with my Bronica SQA and rolls of Velvia 120 and challenging myself to create the most impressive heaped teaspoons imaginable. Here is one example:

That’s 23 sugar cubes. Quite a feat. I’ve also been quite unconventional in the materials I’ve tried to get a heaped teaspoon of. Namely, fire:

[![Fire]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.blog_images_path }}fire.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.blog_images_path }}fire.jpg)

I did set fire to the floor during this one but it wouldn’t be a challenge if there wasn’t danger.

I paused the project for a while as having the Velvia developed and scanned was super-expensive but I’ve recently resumed my spoons.

[![Strawberry Laces]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.blog_images_path }}starwberrylace.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.blog_images_path }}starwberrylace.jpg)

This is multiple strawberry laces, all painstakingly melted onto each other to form one giant lace. Then twirled around. It is quite satisfying.

I have a long list of other things I want to photograph in this project. I’m hoping that once it’s complete I’ll be able to first display it at Flirt in The Triangle. I’ll also create a hardback square book.
