categories: photography projects
snippet: "This is a long-running photography project, trying to seeing how far I
          can push  the &quot;heaped teaspoon&quot; measurement. This project moves
          slowly as I'm using my Bronica and trying to do each spoon in a different
          person's kitchen."
