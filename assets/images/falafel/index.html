       <strong>Welcome to the official website for Steve Guntrip's book Falafel The Cat.</strong><p>

       Mark is an anxiety-riddled hermit of a man, working his life away in a windowless office, spending his free time eating pizza in front of the television with his only companion and best friend, a ginger cat he found in his garden and dubbed Falafel.  <p>
Falafel the Cat goes missing, leaving Mark with the daunting prospect of searching the streets of London for his furry friend. Will Mark find Falafel? Will he talk to any humans? Will he even make it out of his own front door?

        Falafel The Cat is a strange novella following a man who rarely steps outside as he explores the city he lives in for the first time. It has full colourful photographs, foldout pages and some
        made-up words.
