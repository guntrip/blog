     Mark is an anxiety-riddled hermit of a man, working his life away in a windowless office, spending his free time eating pizza in front of the television with his only companion and best friend, a ginger cat he found in his garden and dubbed Falafel.
   <p>
Falafel the Cat goes missing, leaving Mark with the daunting prospect of searching the streets of London for his furry friend. Will Mark find Falafel? Will he talk to any humans? Will he even make it out of his own front door?

   'Falafel The Cat' is my first work of fiction to make it to print. It's an odd story and quite personal. Inside you'll find full colour photographs,
   fold-out sections and even some made-up words. It has been warmly received by those who have read it and I had a lovely time at Flirt café bar in
   Bournemouth's Triangle for the launch party.

   The book is self-published and the best way to purchase it is via Rowdydow, Steve's hair dye shop, where you can also request for it to be signed. You can
   also find Falafel The Cat on Amazon and Imagine Books in Weymouth. Any good bookstore would be able to use the ISBN number to order it in for you. <a href=\"http://www.rowdydow.co.uk/falafel/\">Click here to order Falafel The Cat from Rowdydow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.falafelthecat.co.uk/\">click here to view the dedicated Falafel The Cat website</a>.
