{% comment %}
Jekyll will include this whenever someone visits a post URL (/2018-01/blah), so we'll just
include _includes/post.html here. That keeps it all in one file. This assigns "page" to "post", 
as Jekyll puts the contents in "page" but we use "post" elsewhere.
{% endcomment %}
{% assign full_post = true %}
{% assign post = page %}
{% include post.html %}
