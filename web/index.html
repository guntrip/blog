<p style="margin-top:10px;">I make little things in PHP, JavaScript and other web technologies. Here are a few of them:</p>

<a href="http://stevecat.net/table-magic/" class="bigLink">Table Magic</a>
<p>Helps you to create and convert tables in markdown, CSV, TSV, SQL, HTML and a form.</p>

<a href="http://stevecat.net/catnap/" class="bigLink">Cat Nap</a>
<p>Cat-themed break timer built on Electron.</p>

<a href="http://www.rowdydow.co.uk/eotw/" class="bigLink">End Of The World Notification Service</a>
<p>Alerts you when someone has prophesied the world ending, as featured in The Telegraph. Strangely.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">You'll find other small projects mentioned in the blog and on my <a href="http://www.github.com/github">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
